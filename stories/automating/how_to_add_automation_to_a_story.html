  <h1>howToAddAutomationToAStory</h1>

  <p>
    Stories are written as free form HTML to give maximum expression to the author. The author can add images, video
    and any other artefacts that will help the end customer as well as the developers of the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of automating the story is done by either adding a custom attribute to existing HTML elements or by
    adding a custom tag.  The attribute is auto="methodName" where all of the text inside the tag is passed to the method so
    that the method can be reused with different parameters.  So if the step is in a list item the li tag would look like
  <pre>&lt;li auto="methodName"&gt;This is the content of the step to be autoamated.  It will be passed to the method.&lt;/li&gt;</pre>
    <br/>
    The custom tag will be <pre>&lt;step auto="methodName"&gt;This is the content of the step to be autoamated.  It will be passed to the method.&lt;/step&gt;</pre>
